Users are doing more with web applications than ever before. From laptops to tablets to mobile devices, from coffee shops to conferences to airplanes and road trips, apps are being used in a variety of situations and scenarios. Across all of this usage is a common problem: connectivity can frequently be unreliable or unavailable entirely.

To meet these demands, not only is offline **access** to data essential, but **mutation** should also be possible in the absence of a network connection. And the application should not try to **guess** whether connectivity is available.

## Goals

* Require a **minimal** set of constraints to integrate with as many typical legacy backends as possible.
* Allow data to **flow** bidirectionally when connectivity is available and the UI to function **independently** when the network is **unreliable**.
* Give **application developers** the ability to optimize and enhance this experience with **custom logic** where it will provide the most benefit.
